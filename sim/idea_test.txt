Experiment 1: 
    shoot horizontal beams across different vertical axis and record the radii of the tank and the iron
    do the same for vertical beams across horizontal axis
    angled beam to check diameter

Experiment 2:
   Make planar muon beam shoot at wtp horizontally and vertically while empty
   Make planar muon beam shoot at wtp horizontally and vertically with water (low, mid, high)

Constants:
    always check the material of presence in all experiments
    need to find a way to report path lengths in materials from G4
    better understand how the shower works from CRY and G4

Visualization/Plot Idea:
    path lengths in medium plots
    make plots in G4 and ROOT
    Path length within the iron volume vs the height of beam origin plot 

Shape Generation:
    1D Shape extraction from path length inside tower data (shooting muon horizontally many x layers)
    1D Shape extraction from path length inside tower data (shooting muon horizontally many y layers)
    2D shape generation from the muon path length

Proportion of muons absorbed/scattered:
    Running a sim and generating an image.
